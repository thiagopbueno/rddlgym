Note that this \n models continuous time explicitly since there is only one rover.\n\n The continuous state (x,y,t) consists of robot position (x,y) and time t.\n The discrete state consists of whether each picture-point has been taken. \n The action consists of movements (dx,dy) or the snapping of a picture\n without moving (state-action constraints enforce this exclusion).\n A reward is gained for snapping a picture within the bounding box\n of a picture point -- reward can only be obtained for a picture once.\n\n The goal here is to take as many high-value pictures (within their\n designated radii) as possible within the time constraints.\n\n I can provide a proper version of this domain using circles for \n picture-points and Euclidean distance for time updating on movement.\n\n Motivated by:\n\n   Bresina, J.
